This is the Social Club Server Replacement server for Social Club on GTA IV. restoring the ability to play online on patch 7 and below

You will need IIS, PHP Manager, PHP, and URL Rewrite for IIS

You will need to create a single certificate for all these domains
```
www.rockstargames.com
rockstargames.com
tv.rockstargames.com
socialclub.rockstargames.com
mls.rockstargames.com
```

install PHP Manager, PHP, and URL Rewrite before you start anything, they are in the requirements folder, I just didn't include php directly.
add php to the code and it should already have all the Rewrites coded in the web.config.

I will make a video on setting this up once I get a change. wait for the release of the video if you don't know what to do.
